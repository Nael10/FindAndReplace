### What is this repository for? ###
This repository serves as a technical interview for developers pursuing to attend HiQ's Trainee program.

## Instructions ##
* Your task is to build a web application that processes files containing text.
* The user should upload a file from his or her browser to the server and then be presented with the processed text.
* In the processed text the application should surround every occurrence of the most used word with foo and bar.
    * Example: if the most used word is 'hiq', the processed text should display 'foohiqbar' instead of 'hiq'.
* In this repository you'll find some useful textfiles for testing your application.
